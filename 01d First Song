The field FirstSong (1 byte).
The name FirstSong remained, but it is used for different purposes. 

Bit 7 set 1xxxxxxx changes the AY channel layout from ABC to ACB. 
Some music trackers and emulators allow to use different layouts (BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA). 
It is physically possible to connect AY output pins these ways, but not used in the hardware.
ZX Spectrum music made in some countries used ACB channel layout, because a ZX clone with ACB layout was popular there. 
The most of tracker music in the .ay files (mainly .sqt) have been modified in a tracker to play ABC.
When it's necessary to change the layout, the value of FirstSong should be changed
eg. from 0 to 128

xxxxxXXX
Bits 0-2 define the first song, if the first song to play is not the first song in the AY file 
It is extremely rare, in most cases it is = 0
This is why the number has been reduced from 256 to 7, because almost every AY file can be edited 
to set the proper order of songs. Some files where the first song is the last, because of its size,
rather do not exceed 8 songs. 
In most cases the content of any .ay file can be packed into one block 
and launched by moving the desired data, setting registers using simple Z80 code.

xXXXXxxx
Bits 3-6 define the address of the main loop of the Z80 emulator. 
Originally the main loop is located at address 0 to 7 or 0 to 12. 
Machines with writable memory from 0 may store custom data required for playing music or use RST 0 and RST 8 
to call music routines. 

These 16 settings specify the location of the main loop, where
0 is the loop located at the address 0
Values 1-15 place the loop at different addresses, according to this scheme:

HEX:
value * #1000-#10
DEC:
value * 4096-16

The main loop addresses are set 16 bytes below to minimize collisions with the common locations of music.
Music is often compiled at such addresses as 16384 = #4000, 32768 = #8000 or 49152 = #C000.
So, the addresses of the main loop are (in decimal): 

 0 = 0
 1 = 4080 
 2 = 8176
 3 = 12272
 4 = 16368
 5 = 20464
 6 = 24560
 7 = 28656
 8 = 32752
 9 = 36848
10 = 40944
11 = 40928
12 = 49136
13 = 53232
14 = 57328
15 = 61424
16 = 65520

When moving the main loop, be sure that the address does not collide with the stack, that is often set one byte below the data.
