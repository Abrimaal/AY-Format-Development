The field FirstSong (1 byte) 

Bit 7 set 1xxxxxxx changes the AY channel layout from ABC to ACB. 
Some music trackers and emulators allow to use different layouts (BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA). 
It is physically possible to connect AY output pins these ways, but not used in the hardware.
ZX Spectrum music made in some countries used ACB channel layout, because a ZX clone with ACB layout was popular there. 
The most of tracker music in the .ay files (mainly .sqt) have been modified in a tracker to play ABC.
When it's necessary to change the layout, the value of FirstSong should be changed
eg. from 0 to 128

Bits 0-3 define the address of the main loop of the Z80 emulator. 
Originally the main loop is located at address 0 to 7 or 0 to 12. 
Machines with writable memory from 0 may store custom data required for playing music or use RST 0 and RST 8 
to call music routines. 

These 16 settings specify the location of the main loop, where
0 is the loop located at the address 0
Values 1-15 place the loop at different addresses, according to this scheme:

HEX:
value * #1000 - #10
DEC:
value * 4000 - 16

The main loop addresses are set 16 bytes below to minimize collisions with the common locations of music.
Music is often compiled at such addresses as #4000, #8000 or #C000.

When moving the main loop, be sure that the address does not collide with the stack, that is often set one byte below the data.
