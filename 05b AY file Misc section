Syntax: Year1 Name1 (P) Year2 Name2 #Production @Event
------------------

Year

A four digit number. The year of release. When the year is unknown, but the century known, 
the last digits may be replaced with X or x. Please do not use "?" what may look like an unrecognized character.
Examples: 198X 20xx 19XX

When the year is totally unknown, simply skip it instead of typing XXXX.
Example of the full misc section: (P)
---------------------

Names 

The string after year is usually the name of the release company, group or a person who published the production. 
If the name is identical as the Author name, it's better to put it there than leave it blank. 
It specifies an independent release signed only by the Author. 
The name may be skipped when other data is available.
---------------------

Optional and obsolete tags

It is not necessary, even not desired to use the tags (C), (P) at the beginning, before the year. The recommended syntax is: 

Misc=1986 Software
not 
Misc=(C) 1986 Software

A capital letter in brackets like (P). It has nothing to the distribution licence and copyright.

Tags used:

(P) is the default for all music, it means "published, presented"

(C) may contain copyright info, it is used mainly in commercial games released in 1982-1992, 
the era of commercial arcade conversions, when the author of the AY music was not always the composer. 
Example: (C) 1987 Software

In other cases, (C) means "composed". To use this tag we must be sure that the Author of this tune composed it. 
It also means "created", in case of non-musical productions like sound effects or sample packs.

(M) - a mix, remix, modification of someone else's music. 
Used for modifications of an original tune that uses the same (or similar) player routine or tracker. 
It may be used for mixes/remixes that include changes of speed, pattern order, instrument samples. 
May be also used for a conversion of an existing composition from one tracker to another that makes a difference 
in sound perception. 
Example: 1994 Author1 (M) 2010 Author2
or 1994 Author1 / 2010 Author2

(R) - a remake, rendition, conversion of music created by someone else on another platform like C64, NES, Amiga, arcade or PC. 
It applies also to automatic conversions (from another platform, midi, wave etc.). 
For cover versions of non-computer music, like classical music, rock, dance or other, 
the tags who composed the original song are not necessary. 

@ tag - use without brackets. For a composition presented at a compo, party. In most cases it is optional. 
Please do not include info about the ranking (which place it took, what award it won).

# tag - being one character, containing the name of production, where the song was published. 
It may be a name of a game, music album, audiovisual scene art, if the song title is different than the production name.
---------------------

The misc info may contain more than 1 tag.
