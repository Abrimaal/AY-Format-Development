Restrictions and limitations of AY format.
1. Because of the file structure based on signed relative offsets (-32768 to 32767), 
the largest file must be placed as the last in a multi-track .ay file. 
1a. Many music players ignore the FirstSong. In this case all data may be compiled into a single block, 
then moved at the proper address at .ay song INIT. The custom code at init address should contain such an example code
DI
LD HL, song_01_source
LD DE, song_01_target
LD BC, song_01_length
LDIR
EI
JP song_init

Repeat the sequence for all songs and assembly it together with the data block at the lowest address (recommended 16). 


2. 64kB limit. See .AY file Extended Data section
