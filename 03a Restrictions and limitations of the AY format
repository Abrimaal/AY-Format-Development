Restrictions and limitations of AY format.
1. Because of the file structure based on signed relative offsets (-32768 to 32767), 
the largest file must be placed as the last in a multi-track .ay file. 
1a. Many music players ignore the FirstSong. In this case all data may be compiled into a single block, 
then moved at the proper address at .ay song INIT. The custom code at init address should contain such an example code
DI
LD HL, song_01_source
LD DE, song_01_target
LD BC, song_01_length
LDIR
EI
JP song_init

Repeat the sequence for all songs and assembly it together with the data block at the lowest address (recommended 16). 


2. 64kB limit. Re-compiling AYMakeR and AYSplitter and changing offset values from 2 bytes to 4 will open new possibilities, 
but it will be not compatible with the existing players. 
This modification will allow to emulate memory banks and play uncompressed register dumps in the linear RAM.
