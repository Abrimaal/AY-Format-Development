Extra data blocks can be added to the standard AY files. The number of extra blocks is unlimited.
The beginning of the first extra block is calculated by summarizing all internal AY file blocks.
Bit 6 of FirstSong set indicates that this file has extended data blocks.


Structure:

|______________________|_|____________|_|__________|_|____________________|
^ AY FILE with header ^ H Data block   H Data block H Data block and so on

H = header of the extra block
||____2B____|____2B____|__1B__|____2B____|____2B____|____2B____|____2B____||______ Data block_______ ....___|
|load addr. |block len.|OUT/LD|port addr.|OUT/LD val|ret. addr.|ret. value||

Load address (2B) is the address in memory where the block is loaded. In theory it may be up to 65536 bytes, 
but the AY file uses an internal loop that is responsible for playing music, that is 9 or 13 bytes,
placed by default at address 0 (the address may be different - see the FirstSong document).
This internal loop may be copied to the block if the Load address overlaps the loop.
Load address must not collide with the stack.

Block length (2B) is the length of the block and the indicator of the beginning of the next block or end of file.
It must be identical with the real length of the data block.

OUT/LD (1B) specifies if the memory block is switched by OUT or LD command (a value in the memory, a system variable etc.)
1 bit (not byte would be enough) to specify it, but there may exist other methods of switching blocks in various hardware.

Port address is the address of the OUT port that loads the block into the AY main memory. 
In real hardware this is called RAM paging or bank switching.
If the previous byte OUT/LD is LD, the address is a memory address, not an output port.

OUT/LD value (2B) is the value of OUT command or value in the memory that activates this block.
For OUT the value is always 1B, for LD, reading from the memory it has been increased to 2 bytes,
however some system variables may be much longer. 
This part requires more research.

Return address (2B) and Return value (2B) are the values used to unload the extra block 
and reload the initial AY file content.

Extra blocks are simply added to the AY file by Copy/Paste in a binary editor like Hexplorer.

The AY standard uses little endian byte order in the header, but big endian in the data for Z80.
It should be decided if to use the little endian (Motorola order) or big (Intel and Z80 order)

Example for a 16kB block switched at address #COOO (49152) by OUT 255,16 and returning with OUT 255,0

in little endian, in HEX

CC 00       ;load address
40 00       ;block length
00          ;OUT command switches banks, for LD this byte = 01
00 FF       ;out port
00 10       ;value = decimal 16
00 FF       ;return port is the same
00 00       ;return value (reloads the AY file initial content)

in big endian, in HEX

00 CC       ;load address
00 40       ;block length
00          ;OUT command switches banks, for LD this byte = 01
FF 00       ;out port
10 00       ;value = decimal 16
FF 00       ;return port is the same
00 00       ;return value (reloads the AY file initial content)
