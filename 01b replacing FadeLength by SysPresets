=============================================================

THE LOWER BYTE

The lower byte specifies the hardware configuration. Z80 and interrupt frequency.

0|00|00000 - default value for ZX Spectrum Z80 @3.54MHz, AY @1.77MHz, IR @50Hz

x|x1|xxxxx - bit 5 set indicates NTSC, interrupt rate @60Hz
x|1x|xxxxx - bit 6 set indicates double interrupt frequency, 100Hz or 120Hz.
If such a configuration is not used, this bit will be reserved for special features.

0|xx|xxxxx - if bit 7 is not set, bits 0-4 define Z80 frequency for fine tuning
0|xx|00000 - bits 0-4 = 0 are reserved for ZX Spectrum defaults.
0|00|00001 to 0|00|11111 are various frequencies of Z80 in PAL mode. 

The lower values are reserved for Z80 running at common frequencies in various 
hardware @1MHz, 2.00, ZX81=~3.25, ZX16k=~3.48, CPC=4.00, 6.00, 7.00, 8.00, 14.00 etc.
The highest values will be somehow elastic, to be adjustable by the software developers.
It will allow to define precisely the playing time for non-interrupt sounds such as 
samples, beeper engines and for ZX clones (or evolution hardware) not always using identical frequencies. 

1|00|00000 - the highest byte set indicates a non-ZX hardware. 
This value is reserved for Amstrad CPC (Z80 @4.00MHz, AY @1.00MHz, IR @standard - music routine called at 50Hz)

1|00|00001 - and so on to 1|xx|xxxxx - specify different hardware configurations. 

When the bit 7 is set, the Z80 and sound chip frequencies are forced by default. 
Bits 0-4 are used to define hardware configurations such as:

1|00|00000 = Amstrad CPC (interrupt music only)
1|00|00001 = Amstrad CPC (full emulation for samples, digi music etc.)
1|00|00010 = SAM Coupe (interrupt music only)
1|00|00011 = SAM Coupe (full emulation for samples, digi music etc.)
1|00|00010 to 1|xx|11111 = yet another, evolutionary ZX-based computers, 
consoles using Z80+AY or Z80+different soundchip(s), arcade cabinets etc.

=============================================================

THE HIGHER BYTE specifies the sound chip(s) setting.

For standard configurations, forced by bit 7 of the low byte, the higher byte should be = 0. 
While the low byte = 10000010 indicates SAM Coupe with SAA-1099 chip, it is not necessary to 
specify the sound chip in the high byte.

In case of ZX Spectrum with SAA chip, that may possibly use custom player engines, 
containing sample players or two chips playing simultaneously, such configuration 
must be defined in the high byte. 
The same refers to double AY chip (turbosound), AY+SAA, AY+YM2xxx (turbosound FM), Amstrad CPC with two AY chips etc.

The bit count and order for the presets must be discussed and if necessary, shifted or rearranged.
